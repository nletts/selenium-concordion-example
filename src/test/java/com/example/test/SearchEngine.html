            the first paragraph will read:
            <b concordion:assertEquals="searchFor(#word)">In software testing, test automation is the use of special 
            software (separate from the software being tested) to control the execution of tests and the comparison of 
            actual outcomes with predicted outcomes.[1] Test automation can automate some repetitive but necessary 
            tasks in a formalized testing process already in place, or add additional testing that would be difficult 
            to perform manually.</b>
